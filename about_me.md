title: "About Me"

Although I primarily use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/) for my Data Science projects, I have some experience coding in [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) being my IDE of choice. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) round out the list of the tools I frequently use.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing table tennis and, occassionally, basketball.
