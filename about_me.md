    About Me
</h1>

Although I primarily use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/) for my Data Science projects, I have some experience coding in [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) being my IDE of choice. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) round out the list of the tools I frequently use.

Outside of work, I play [table tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis#Penhold) as a [Penholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_styles#Penhold_grip).

Current table tennis equipment:

+ **Blade**: DHS G8
+ **Forehand and Backhand Rubbers**: DHS Hurricane II (inverted pips)
