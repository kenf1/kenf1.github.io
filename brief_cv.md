## Select Presentations (Descending Order)

1. [Learning R, From Beginner to Coding Machine](https://kf-rjourney.netlify.app/)

    + **Summary**: A SIG/RIG presentation on how I learned the R programming language as someone with near zero prior coding experience. This presentation includes demos/showcases of how R can be incorporated into a Data Science workflow. At the end, I will be giving general advice for those who are interested in learning R but don't know how/where to start.

1. [Kaggle Spaceship Titanic Competition using R](https://github.com/kenf1/KaggleST-R)
    
    + My R code for the [Kaggle Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) competition that achieved a first submission score of **0.78442**.
    + The maximum submission score is 1.00000 which is near-impossible as no model/prediction algorithm is 100% accurate.

    + An R package containing custom functions and templates intended to improve my workflow in R.
